# Hierarchical Clustering of Keystroke Data: Profiling Students in Programming Courses

This repo contains all the code used for the final project, "Hierarchical Clustering of Keystroke Data: Profiling Students in Programming Courses."

## Project summary: 

Understanding student engagement and performance can enhance learning outcomes. Traditional assessment methods often fall short in providing insights into students' behaviors and struggles. This research aims to explore how hierarchical clustering can be applied to keystroke data of a programming course to uncover insights into student engagement, coding behaviors, and learning patterns.

## Dataset:

The data used in this study was collected from a cohort of students enrolled in an introductory programming course CS1. The dataset have a rich metadata consist of submission, compilation, edit, and keystroke events.
